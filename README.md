Here is my weather dashboard app

This weeks challenge was to create a weather dashboard using the Open Weather API.

When you open the app, you will be met with a search box to search for a city, when you hit the search button, the current weather will be displayed in the box to the right, and you will also be given a 5 day forecast at the bottom of the page.

If you want to search for more than 1 locations weather, you can do so easily while the cities weather you previously searched for will be added to the search history list, utilizing local storage, and if you want to recheck that locations weather, simply click the button and you will be presented with it.
